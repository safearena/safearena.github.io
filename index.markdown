## Are Web Agents Safe?

LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly proficient at solving web-based tasks. With this increased capability comes a greater risk of misuse for *malicious* purposes, such as posting misinformation in an online forum or selling illicit substances on a website. To evaluate these risks, we propose **SafeArena**, the first benchmark to focus on the deliberate misuse of web agents.

## SafeArena

**SafeArena** comprises 250 safe and 250 harmful tasks across four websites. We classify the harmful tasks into five harm categories---*misinformation*, *illegal activity*, *harassment*, *cybercrime*, and *social bias*---designed to assess realistic misuses of web agents.

## How Do Current Agents Perform?

We evaluate several leading LLM-based web agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Qwen-2 72B, and Llama-3.2 90B, on our benchmark. 

Overall Performance            |  Normalized Safety Score

We find that agents are surprisingly compliant with malicious requests, with GPT-4o and Qwen-2 completing 22.8% and 26.0% of the harmful intents, respectively. Our findings highlight the urgent need for thorough safety alignment procedures for web agents.
